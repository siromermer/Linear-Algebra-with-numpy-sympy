## Linear Algebra Lectures
<br>
Most of the examples that I used in this notebooks are from INTRODUCTION TO LINEAR ALGEBRA (GILBERT STRANG)
<br><br>

* Chapter 1 --> Linear Combinations of Vectors
* Chapter 2 --> Solving Linear Equations Ax = b
* Chapter 3 --> The Four Fundamental Subspaces
* Chapter 4 --> Orthogonality
* Chapter 5 --> Determinant
